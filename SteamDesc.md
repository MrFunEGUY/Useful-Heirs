[h1]Useful Heirs:[/h1]

I've always thought that heirs should be more useful and interesting in this game. This mod is me trying to achieve that.

With Useful Heirs, you can:

- Appoint your heir as a leader.

- Designate any of your leaders as your heir.

- Abdicate the throne in favor of your heir.

[h1]Notes:[/h1]

- Former Heirs won't stick around. Politically speaking, it would be pretty wild.

- If you fire your Leader Heir, they will also be removed as your heir. On the one hand, this is a little annoying. On the other hand, this lets you get rid of heirs you don't like and reroll them, essentially. In the future, I will be looking for ways around this, but it may be out of my control.

- When your Heir becomes your Ruler, they will not be able to continue doing their old job. Running an empire is a full-time gig.

- There is currently no way to completely unassign an heir so that they are not a leader anymore. I will try to figure out a way around this.

- In relation to my Civil Wars mod, Leader Heirs will not be able to rebel. I'll probably look into further interactions with this, though. Seems ripe for opportunity.

- Sometimes, there is a small graphical bug that occurs after switching an heir's leader role where they will appear as -1 years old, unnamed, and not be able to be fired. This is only graphical, and can be fixed by reassigning a leader or recruiting a new leader.

--

- You can designate any leader as your heir for 500 influence. This will also cause your planets to lose some stability for 10 years. -10 Stability for the capital, -2 Stability for every other planet.

- There is a new civic, Adoptive Dynasties, that grants +10 Stability and allows you to designate heirs without the stability hit or influence cost. If a dynastic heir ascends to the throne while you have this civic, you will lose the bonus stability. The capital will lose 15 stability and every other world will lose 10 stability. Practically, this means that you go from +10 to -10 on non-capital worlds, for a 20 stability hit.

--

- The AI will use the feature to designate their heir as a leader.

- Starting at age 70, an AI will begin to consider abdicating the throne to their heir every year. The chance that they will abdicate increases every five years. The abdicating ruler may also decide to become a regular leader in the empire. This isn't really relevant to the player, but if you like RP and stuff like I do it's neat.

If you're also using my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434790082]Civil Wars[/url] mod, disinherited heirs can cause problems. The consquences may take years to occur, such as when the old leader dies, or they may occur quickly. This can be mitigated by Adoptive Dynasties, but even then once an heir is appointed they will not take kindly to being disinherited. Disinherited heirs may also try to run away to a foreign empire. Foreign empires will have the choice of whether to grant them asylum. If they accept, the heir will become a leader for that empire, and they will gain a Casus Belli to install them on their old throne. You will also gain a Casus Belli to retrieve them.

The player may also be given the option to accept disinherited Heirs (and other leaders, because you do need my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434790082]Civil Wars[/url] mod for these features) from other countries into their empire, if the situation occurs.

This can even happen if you change your government type away from Imperial (or any other modded government that uses Heirs, like my Private Corporate authority in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2158334880]More Authorities[/url]). From the Heir's perspective, what's the difference?

[h1]Compatibility:[/h1]

- Should be compatible with everything, as it alters no vanilla files. It will also be compatible with any additional modded government authority that uses heirs.

- Compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2077690562]Enhanced Traits,[/url] but I advise using my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198699628]Enhanced Traits - Bugfixes patch,[/url] that fixes some issues in Enhanced Traits.
