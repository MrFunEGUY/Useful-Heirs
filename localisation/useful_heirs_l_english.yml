 civic_adoptive_dynasties_desc: "A dynasty of inneffective rulers in the distant past has led to a tradition in this society whereby the monarch typically appoints their heir from amongst the most capable individuals in their court. This has resulted in a very stable empire. However, until an heir is appointed, the heir is still chosen via absolute primogeniture."
